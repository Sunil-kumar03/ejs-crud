# Project Working Steps

## After connecting template engines

1. First make sure that mongodb connected
2. Next step is we need to create a database scheme in model

a. open userModel
b. design the db scheme (which include field names of table and data type)
example : user=> filedName = datatype
name = string
email = string
mobile = string
age = number
you can continue the fields depend on requirements
now we will consider only 4 fields
